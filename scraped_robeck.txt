Request Appointment Request Appointment Request Appointment But pain rapidly changes your awareness in any part of the body. Tooth pain can be especially alarming, and its meant to warn you that somethings not right. Pain tells us that the bundle of nerves and vessels inside your tooth is irritated, damaged, or under attack.A deep cavity can give bacteria access to the inner nerve bundle. A crack extending into the same region can create stress that will need additional care to relieve. In some cases, a significant infection may develop in your jaw without any symptoms at all. If we determine that the nerve wont recover or infection is present, then root canal treatment may be suggested.Modern anesthetics provide powerful numbing for gentle removal of the inflamed nerve inside the tooth. The nerve canal undergoes disinfection and careful shaping, and a sealer fills the internal space. Afillingorcrownover the tooth helps return the tooth to its original condition.But Are They Safe?Internet articles continue to circulate claiming adverse health effects from root canals, despite years of research proving otherwise. Many of these claims rest on unsubstantiated theories put forward decades ago without any scientific basis. Theyve been thoroughly debunked by the most credible sources, supported by unbiased research projects. In fact, one popular Facebook article sounding a false alarm shakily rests on a 100yearold study tossed aside long ago.Professional organizations routinely review a broad range of research projects throughout the world. The American Association of Endodontists stays abreast of all the current and past research and can clearly support the safety of this vital service. In fact, new techniques and materials make root canal treatment more successful than ever. However, even older methods still hold a proven track record, allowing millions of damaged teeth to continue functioning.Experience how Dr. Robeck can help you discover your perfect smile.Request Appointment But pain rapidly changes your awareness in any part of the body.
